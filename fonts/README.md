# Annotation fonts (optional)

Drop a `.ttf`, `.ttc`, or `.otf` file here to use it for on-video annotations. The app will use it on any OS; font **size** is still scaled automatically from the video resolution.

If this folder is empty, the app uses a system font (Helvetica on macOS, Arial on Windows, DejaVu on Linux).
